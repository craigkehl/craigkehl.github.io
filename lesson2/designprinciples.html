        <h2>White Space</h2>
        <p>Champion Porsche is the highest volume Porsche Dealer in the world. Their product speaks volumes and they recognize that. By allowing plenty of white space around their photos, they allow the user to begin imagining what it would be like to own the car. </p>

        <h2>Contrast</h2>
        <p>Brett David, owner of Prestige Auto in Miami Florida, once told me, "When you want to be somebody you buy a Ferrari. When you are somebody, you drive a Lamborghini." Why do Lamborghini owners drive vibrant and often neon-colors Lamborghinis? Because they want to stand-out. That is what contrast does. It screams, <span id="lamboDriver">"Hey! Pay attention to me."</span></p>
